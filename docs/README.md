## 🛡️ Key Architectural Guarantees

1. **MCAT 4-Choice Purity**: Strictly 4 options (A, B, C, D) per question, perfectly length-balanced ($\pm 15\%$) to eliminate guessing cues. Zero multi-choice or legacy 5-choice artifacts.
2. **Deterministic Quality Gate (>90 Points)**: Every question is audited against an uncompromising 100-point rubric. Unrepaired questions that fail after 3 cycles are discarded immediately.
3. **Blind-Solver Dual Validation**: Every candidate is solved blindly without answer key access. Any key discrepancy or confidence $< 88\%$ triggers automatic remediation.
4. **Soft-Deletion & Batch Integrity**: Non-destructive deletion on questions and reading passages preserves background batch execution progress metrics intact while excluding items from active catalog views, with full restoration support (`POST /api/questions/{id}/restore`).
5. **Question Deduplication & Anti-Collision Safeguard**: Hybrid multi-metric similarity detection ($\ge 0.80$) scoped by Section and Subtopic prevents duplicate question stems, with an autonomous pivot loop, cluster management, and educator side-by-side override audit trail (`is_duplicate_override`).
6. **Review Queue Withholding Guarantee**: Staged questions from running batches stay in `batch_only` status and are strictly withheld from reviewer queues until the batch cleanly completes, at which point questions with scores $> 90$ are atomically promoted to `ai_validated`.
7. **Custom Authoring Instructions Enforcement**: Educator directives (`additional_instructions`) in Guided Wizard Step 3 are injected into prompt builders with high-priority mandate across all generation and critique cycles.
8. **Sub-Micro-Cent Cost Precision & Anti-AI Formatting**: Every token is mathematically accounted for, rounded to 7 decimal places, and persisted alongside question records in PostgreSQL. Strictly forbids em dashes (`—`) or en dashes (`–`).
9. **Zero-Defect Code Hygiene**: Full test suite with 90 passing deterministic unit and integration tests across 17 modules (100 total backend tests), 15 TestSprite Playwright E2E tests (100% pass rate), 0 Ruff errors, and 0 Oxlint warnings.
