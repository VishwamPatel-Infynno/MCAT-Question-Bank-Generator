## 🛠️ Development Environment Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Node.js 20+** & **pnpm (v9+)**
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for PostgreSQL 16)
- High-Throughput Inference Gateway credentials

### 2. Local Database
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
Verifies that PostgreSQL 16 is running on port `5432` with database `mcat_db`.

### 3. Backend Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```
Run FastAPI dev server:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=backend uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000 --reload
```

### 4. Frontend Setup
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## 🧪 Testing & Verification Guidelines

Before submitting any code changes, ensure all verification suites pass with zero defects (see [`docs/TESTING_AND_QA.md`](file:///Users/infynnosolutions/Desktop/Code/Question%20Bank%20Generator/docs/TESTING_AND_QA.md) for full test specifications):

```bash
# 1. Backend pytest suite (73 deterministic unit & integration tests across 15 modules; 42 pass offline, 31 DB tests skip cleanly)
PYTHONPATH=backend pytest backend/tests -v -m "not live_e2e"

# 2. Backend Python linter and formatting checks (enforcing SIM, RET, B, C4, E, W, F, I, UP)
ruff check backend/
ruff format --check backend/

# 3. Frontend Oxlint linter (0 errors, 0 warnings policy across 97 files)
pnpm --dir frontend lint

# 4. Frontend production build (compiles in ~218ms via Vite 8)
pnpm --dir frontend build
```

## 📐 Multi-Agent Architectural Principles

1. **Strict Quality Threshold**: Questions scoring $\le 90$ must be regenerated up to 3 times by the Re-Generator agent. If still below 90, the workflow must halt and reject the question from the Question Bank.
2. **Blind-Solver Dual Validation**: Every candidate question is solved blindly without knowing the author's key or explanation. Any key discrepancy or confidence $< 88\%$ triggers automatic remediation to ensure question keys are incontrovertible.
3. **Review Queue Withholding Guarantee**: Questions produced during background batches are held safely in `batch_only` status while the batch is in progress to prevent partial/draft questions from leaking into the reviewer queue. High-scoring items (>90) are atomically promoted to `ai_validated` upon batch completion.
4. **Custom Authoring Instructions Enforcement**: Educator directives (`additional_instructions`) supplied via Step 3 must be injected into prompt builders with high-priority pedagogical mandate across passage drafting, question drafting, and remediation critique cycles.
5. **Deterministic Token & Cost Math**: All costs must be computed via official DeepInfra rates:
   - Text: $0.098 input / $0.294 output per 1M tokens.
   - Image: Flat baseline rate of $0.014 USD per image (scaled by $(\text{width}/1024) \times (\text{height}/1024)$).
6. **Modular Layer Separation**:
   - Routing: `backend/app/api/v1/` (28 operations across 22 endpoint paths)
   - Business/Agent Logic: `backend/app/agents/` (Generator, Blind Solver, Reviewer, Regenerator, Visuals)
   - Data Access Layer: `backend/app/repositories/`
   - Database Entities: `backend/app/models/`
   - Background Services: `backend/app/services/` (`batch_runner.py` with global job semaphores)
   - Frontend: Top-level views (`views/`) with feature-based component directories (`wizard/`, `pipeline/`, `question/`, `passage/`, `staged/`, `bank/`, `batch/`, `validated/`, `layout/`, `modals/`, `common/`) and centralized hooks/constants.
5. **Multi-Agent Pipeline & Cognitive Fusion**: Step 01 fuses item authoring and 100-point rubric self-critique (`Drafting & Review`) into a single pass. Step 02 executes independent dual validation (`Answer Check`). Step 03 executes remediation (`Question Polish`) for drafts scoring $\le 90$ or failing verification, while Step 04 renders visual stimuli (`Figures & Diagrams`).
6. **AAMC Dual Split-Pane Reading Mode**: Ensures dense scientific research passages and CARS essays are presented side-by-side with sticky scrolling and synchronized candidate review.
7. **Option Symmetry & Anti-AI Standard**: Enforce $\pm 15\%$ option length parity across strictly 4 options ($A, B, C, D$) and single hyphens (`-`) only; em dashes (`—`) and en dashes (`–`) are strictly forbidden across prompts and generation output.

## 📬 Pull Request Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your commits using standard conventional commit messages:
   - `feat:` new feature or capability
   - `fix:` bug fix
   - `docs:` documentation improvements
   - `refactor:` code restructuring without changing behavior
   - `test:` adding or improving tests
3. Push to your fork and submit a Pull Request targeting `main`.
